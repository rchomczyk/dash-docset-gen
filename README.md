# dash-docset-gen
Simple and lightweight docset generator for the documentation made with Javadocs, currently it only supports the generation of the English localized documentations, because of the really weird reading process.

## Disclaimer
This project isn't ready to use on production, because it is just a side project, which was made only for generating the documentation for my own purposes.
